Currently, I am working on reasoning for Multimodal Language Models (MLMs) at LCS2 under [Dr. Tanmoy Chakroborty](https://tanmoychak.com/) and [Dr. Akshay Nambi (MSR, India)](https://tanmoychak.com/). Previously, I was an intern at [CynLr](https://www.cynlr.com/) (please check them out), a robotics research organisation where I will be working on Machine Vision, Reinforcement Learning and hardware-level computer vision. I have also worked with [Dr. Ranjitha Prasad](https://sites.google.com/site/ranjithap/home) at IIIT-Delhi, [Prof Ravi Kiran S](https://ravika.github.io/) at IIIT-H. I have also interned at [KLIV, IIT Kharagpur](https://iitkliv.github.io/).
